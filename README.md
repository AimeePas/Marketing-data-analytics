## Marketing Campaign & Channel Performance Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end analysis of marketing performance data to identify the best campaign and channel combination for converting new customers. 
The project evaluates sales, conversions, and engagement across Email, Instagram, and Web Banner channels for Campaigns A and B, 
segmented by customer type (New vs Existing).

Using data visualisation and conversion metrics, the analysis reveals the strongest drivers of new-customer acquisition and provides clear recommendations for future targeting strategies.

## Analytical Objectives

- Quantify conversion performance across channels and campaign variants.

- Compare new vs. existing customer behavior.

- Identify channel–campaign combinations with the highest acquisition efficiency.

- Evaluate whether higher total sales correlate with higher new-customer conversions.

- Produce visual insights to support strategic marketing decisions.

## Key Findings

- Email is the highest-performing channel overall, driving 54% of total conversions
across both customer segments.

- Despite Campaign B generating higher total revenue
(A = $5,869.56, B = $8,790.04),
Campaign A yields higher new-customer conversion rates.

- The strongest new-customer acquisition outcome was produced by:
Email + Campaign A → $2,124.47 new customer sales.

- Across Instagram and Web Banner, Campaign A consistently outperforms B for new-customer conversions, confirming a campaign-level effect rather than channel-specific variance.

## Methods & Techniques

* Data cleaning & preprocessing

* Grouped aggregation (campaign × channel × customer type)

* Conversion rate calculation
(converted ÷ total interactions)

* Ratio and proportional analysis

* Comparative performance modeling

* Visualisation using bar charts and performance summaries



## Final Recommendation

For maximising new-customer acquisition, the optimal strategy is:

** Prioritise Campaign A delivered through Email.**

This combination demonstrates the strongest performance across all analytical metrics and channels.
