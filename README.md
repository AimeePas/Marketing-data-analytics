## Marketing Campaign & Channel Performance Analysis

This repository provides an end-to-end analysis of marketing performance data to identify the best campaign and channel combinations for converting new customers in BCG X.

The dataset contains 500 rows and 7 columns, capturing key campaign metrics across different channels.

The project evaluates sales, conversions, and engagement across Email, Instagram, and Web Banner channels for Campaigns A and B, 
segmented by customer type (New vs Existing).

Using data visualisation and conversion metrics, the analysis reveals the strongest drivers of new customer acquisition and provides clear recommendations for future targeting strategies.

## Problem Statement 
Which campaign + channel combo should the client double down on to grow new customer sales and why?

## Analytical Objectives

- Quantify conversion performance across channels and campaign variants.

- Compare new vs. existing customer behavior.

- Identify channel–campaign combinations with the highest acquisition efficiency.

- Evaluate whether higher total sales correlate with higher new-customer conversions.

- Produce visual insights to support strategic marketing decisions.

## Key Findings


1. Total Sales by Campaign

- Campaign B generated higher total sales than Campaign A.

- This indicates that overall revenue was stronger for Campaign B across all channels.

2. Total Sales Across Channel and Campaign

- Email is the highest-performing channel, accounting for 54% of total conversions across both customer segments.

- Other channels (Instagram, Web Banner) contributed less but show consistent patterns depending on the campaign.

Despite Campaign B generating higher total revenue
Campaign A yields higher new-customer conversion rates.


- Campaign A achieves higher new-customer conversion rates, especially via Email.

- The strongest new-customer acquisition combination is:
Email + Campaign A → $2,124.47 in new-customer sales.

4. Insights by Channel

- Across Instagram and Web Banner, Campaign A consistently outperforms Campaign B for new-customer conversions.

- This confirms a campaign-level effect rather than a channel-specific variance.

- Key takeaway: while Campaign B is better for total revenue, Campaign A is more effective at acquiring new customers.

## Methods & Techniques

* Data cleaning & preprocessing

* Grouped aggregation (campaign × channel × customer type)

* Conversion rate calculation
(converted ÷ total interactions)

* Ratio and proportional analysis

* Comparative performance modeling

* Visualisation using bar charts and performance summaries



## Final Recommendation

For maximising new-customer acquisition, the optimal strategy is:

**Prioritise Campaign A delivered through Email.**

This combination demonstrates the strongest performance across all analytical metrics and channels.
This combination demonstrates the strongest performance across all analytical metrics and channels.

Secondary campaigns or channels (Instagram, Web Banner) may be used to supplement overall reach but should not be the primary focus for new-customer acquisition.
