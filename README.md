## Marketing Campaign & Channel Performance Analysis

This repository provides an end-to-end analysis of marketing performance data to identify the best campaign and channel combinations for converting new customers in BCG X.

The dataset contains 500 rows and 7 columns, capturing key campaign metrics across different channels.

The project evaluates sales, conversions, and engagement across Email, Instagram, and Web Banner channels for Campaigns A and B, 
segmented by customer type (New vs Existing).

Using data visualisation and conversion metrics, the analysis reveals the strongest drivers of new-customer acquisition and provides clear recommendations for future targeting strategies.

## Analytical Objectives

- Quantify conversion performance across channels and campaign variants.

- Compare new vs. existing customer behavior.

- Identify channel–campaign combinations with the highest acquisition efficiency.

- Evaluate whether higher total sales correlate with higher new-customer conversions.

- Produce visual insights to support strategic marketing decisions.

## Key Findings

- Email is the highest-performing channel overall, driving 54% of total conversions
across both customer segments.

- Despite Campaign B generating higher total revenue
(A = $5,869.56, B = $8,790.04),
Campaign A yields higher new-customer conversion rates.

- The strongest new-customer acquisition outcome was produced by:
Email + Campaign A → $2,124.47 new customer sales.

- Across Instagram and Web Banner, Campaign A consistently outperforms B for new-customer conversions, confirming a campaign-level effect rather than channel-specific variance.

## Methods & Techniques

* Data cleaning & preprocessing

* Grouped aggregation (campaign × channel × customer type)

* Conversion rate calculation
(converted ÷ total interactions)

* Ratio and proportional analysis

* Comparative performance modeling

* Visualisation using bar charts and performance summaries



## Final Recommendation

For maximising new-customer acquisition, the optimal strategy is:

** Prioritise Campaign A delivered through Email.**

This combination demonstrates the strongest performance across all analytical metrics and channels.
